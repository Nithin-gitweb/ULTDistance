# ULTDistance

This project uses a Arduino UNO micro controller. A Ultrasonic sensor and a 16x2 LCD module has been interfaced with Arduino. The Arduino board has been programmed in such a way that it takes the value from the ultrasonic sensor, which is the duration value and calculates the distance. Then the distance value is printed in the LCD module.
