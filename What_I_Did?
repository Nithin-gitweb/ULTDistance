I have connected the ultrasonic sensor and LCD 16x2 to Arduino and it has been programmed in such a way that the input value which is 
given from the ULT sensor by calculating the duration of trigger and echo values. Then the arduino calculates the current distance
from the obstacle and displays it in LCD. I have placed this whole setup on top of the water body so that the current level of the
water in the container can be acknowledged. 

DEVELOPMENT:
  This can be connected to a relay switch which is indeed connected to a motor pump so that whenever there occors a excess flow 
  of water, the moto pumo can be switched off!
